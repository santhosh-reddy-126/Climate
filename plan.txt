Climate Change Modeling Machine Learning Project

Developed a machine learning model to predict climate change indicators such as temperature changes, sea level rise, and the impact of greenhouse gases. Utilized historical climate data and machine learning techniques to analyze trends and make future projections.

Key Features:

Daily Temperature (USA):

Purpose: Analyze short-term and long-term temperature trends.
Details: Used daily temperature data, calculated rolling averages (7-day, 30-day), and performed year-over-year comparisons to identify patterns and anomalies.
Yearly Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Concentration (USA):

Purpose: Study the impact of GHG emissions on temperature and sea level rise.
Details: Incorporated yearly GHG levels (CO2, methane), tracked cumulative emissions, and applied lagged variables to assess their long-term effects on climate indicators.
Global Monthly Sea Level Data:

Purpose: Predict sea level rise and its relationship to temperature and GHG emissions.
Details: Analyzed monthly sea level data, calculated the rate of change, and accounted for seasonal effects on sea level variations (e.g., thermal expansion in warmer months).
Time Features (Day, Month, Year):

Purpose: Capture seasonal and long-term climate patterns.
Details: Used day, month, and year features to model time-based patterns in temperature and sea level data.
Interaction Features:

Purpose: Explore combined effects of multiple climate factors.
Details: Created interaction terms between temperature and GHG levels to assess their joint impact on sea level rise and climate trends.
Rolling and Lagged Averages:

Purpose: Smooth short-term volatility and track delayed effects.
Details: Applied rolling averages and lagged features for temperature, sea level, and GHG data to highlight consistent trends and capture delayed responses.
Temperature Anomalies:

Purpose: Detect unusual temperature variations.
Details: Calculated deviations from historical temperature averages to track anomalies, signaling climate change indicators.
Sea Level Anomalies:

Purpose: Identify unusual changes in sea levels.
Details: Measured deviations from expected sea level trends based on historical data to detect abnormal rises or falls.
